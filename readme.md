# Calculator
![GitHub last commit](https://img.shields.io/github/last-commit/GianSinghSarao/Calc.svg?style=flat-square)

A simple electron based calculator app made with the FOAM Framework with 29 functions for basic arithmetic, algebra, trigonometry and discrete math.

This Was A Chrome App, But Seeing As Chrome Apps Are Leaving Platforms Other Than Chrome OS And Android, It Seemed Worthwhile, To Quickly Port The Web Version (Available As A Sample App For The FOAM Framework), To Electron.

### Binary Files For Windows
Note: Said Binary Files Are Not Installers, They Are The Electron Executables Which Start The App. 
First Clone The Repository, Then Execute ```Create-bin.ps1```. The Powershell Script Will Consult You If It Needs Help And Run The Appropriate Commands For You When It Doesn't. 
### Binary Files For Linux
A Bash Script That Runs The Appropriate Commands Is Still A Work In Progress.
### Binary Files For MacOS??
Currently, I'm Not Intending To Target MacOS, As I Don't Currently Have The Means To Sign The Program.
