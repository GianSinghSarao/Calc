# Calculator
![GitHub last commit](https://img.shields.io/github/last-commit/GianSinghSarao/Calc.svg?style=flat-square)

A simple electron based calculator app made with the FOAM Framework with 29 functions for basic arithmetic, algebra, trigonometry and discrete math.

This Was A Chrome App, But Seeing As Chrome Apps Are Leaving Platforms Other Than Chrome OS And Android, It Seemed Worthwhile, To Quickly Port The Web Version (Available As A Sample App For The FOAM Framework), To Electron.

## Binary Files
Note: Said Binary Files Are Not Installers, They Are The Electron Executables Which Start The App. 
First Clone The Repository, Then Execute ```Create-bin.(ps1\sh)```. The (Powershell\Bash) Script Will Consult You If It Needs Help And Run The Appropriate Commands For You When It Doesn't. The Powershell Script Will Produce Executables For Windows, And The Bash Script Will Produce The Executables For Linux.
### Binary Files For MacOS??
Currently, I'm Not Intending To Target MacOS, As I Don't Currently Have The Means To Sign The Program.
