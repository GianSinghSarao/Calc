Google recently (January 2022) released the calculator app they made as a PWA, so this is now entirely unneccessary. It's installable at/from [https://calculator.apps.chrome/](https://calculator.apps.chrome/). Though who knows if it'll always be there, So instead of deleting this repo, I'll archive it. Just in case they take down the web app 5 or 10 years in the future. Anyway, I only made this repo because I wanted to keep using this specific calculator app after the deprecation of chrome apps. And considering that I've never updated the electron version used, It is currently very out of date. Because I cannot be bothered to maintain it, I'm archiving it.

## Calculator
![GitHub last commit](https://img.shields.io/github/last-commit/GianSinghSarao/Calc.svg?style=flat-square)

A simple electron based calculator app made with the FOAM Framework with 29 functions for basic arithmetic, algebra, trigonometry and discrete math.

This Was A Chrome App, But Seeing As Chrome Apps Are Leaving Platforms Other Than Chrome OS And Android, It Seemed Worthwhile, To Quickly Port The Web Version (Available As A Sample App For The FOAM Framework), To Electron.

## Binary Files
Note: Said Binary Files Are Not Installers, They Are The Electron Executables Which Start The App. 
First Clone The Repository, Then Execute ```Create-bin.(ps1\sh)```. The (Powershell\Bash) Script Will Consult You If It Needs Help And Run The Appropriate Commands For You When It Doesn't. The Powershell Script Will Produce Executables For Windows, And The Bash Script Will Produce The Executables For Linux.
### Binary Files For MacOS??
Currently, I'm Not Intending To Target MacOS, As I Don't Currently Have The Means To Sign The Program.
